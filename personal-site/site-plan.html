        A straightforward guide to the basics of Autism Spectrum Disorder and how to support Autistic people
        <br><br>
        The Internet is full of information about Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). It can be confusing, overwhelming, and is sometimes just downright incorrect. If you’re looking to better support your Autistic friends & loved ones, or the community as a whole, but don’t know where to start, this website is for you! We’ve organized all of the basic information and support tips you need to be an Autism Ally, in a site curated by an Autistic person.

      <p>
        Use This Instead: <br>
        There are a lot of outdated or straight-up incorrect terms when it comes to ASD. Make sure you’re using the right ones with this simple guide.
        <br><br>
        Outdated Term #1: Asperger’s Syndrome
        <br><br>
        Why don’t we use it?
        <br>
        The term “Asperger’s Syndrome” comes from a man named Hans Asperger. Up until about 2018, people thought Asperger was a pioneering pediatrician that resisted the Nazi eugenics program during World War II and saved autistic children from camps, because this is what Asperger claimed he had done. In 2018, however, his actual writings and the actual records from his clinic were found and told a very different story. Asperger was highly affiliated with the National Socialist (Nazi) Party in World War II, and participated heavily in their eugenics program, consistently describing autistic people as “psychopathic” and arguing that autistic children were not fit for society and should be terminated. He conducted unethical experiments on autistic children and was a prominent part of a committee that personally sent dozens of autistic children to their deaths, simply for being autistic. To honor the children that died, and to end the honoring of a terrible man, the Autistic community urges people to no longer use this term to describe Autistic people.
        <br><br>
        What to use instead:
        <br>
        ‘Autism’ and ‘Autism Spectrum Disorder’ (ASD) are often used interchangeably, though some prefer ‘Autism Spectrum Condition’ (ASC) over ASD. The majority of the Autistic community is totally okay with any of the three. Remember, Autism is not a bad word, and doesn’t need to be watered down.
        <br><br>
        Outdated Term #2: Functioning Labels (High-functioning/Low-functioning)
        <br><br>
        Why don’t we use it?
        <br>
        There are three reasons why we don’t use functioning labels. First, every autistic person has different strengths and weaknesses that are too complex to be put on a single line that goes from high to low. The spectrum looks more like a chart than a line, and there is no such thing as being ‘more’ or ‘less’ autistic. Second, the label “high-functioning” often leads to those Autistic people to whom the label was applied to having their needs taken less seriously, or even some parents of autistic children that would then be labeled “low-functioning” trying to exclude “high-functioning” Autistic people from their own community because they were considered “not Autistic enough” by the ignorant. Third, imagine how it would feel to be constantly labeled “low-functioning” just because you struggle with certain things more than others do. An Autistic person’s struggles and needs do not define how well they can “function” as a human being. All in all, functioning labels are dehumanizing.
        <br><br>
        What to use instead:
        <br>
        Measure by support needs and masking levels instead of so-called “functioning”. For example, some people may have higher support needs, others may have lower support needs (also called high-masking). However, remember that this is an abstract metric intended only for colloquial use. You should never assume someone’s level of support needs, and the support and accommodations Autistic people receive should always be based on their individual needs, not any sub-label. Clinical levels of autism (Level 1, 2, 3) are also considered an acceptable term by many Autistic people when describing their support needs, though are more so used in discussing the clinical aspects of Autism.
        <br><br>
        Terminology:
        Here are some common terms you may hear used in relation to ASD, but not fully know what they mean. There are many more, but these are just a few more common ones.
        <br><br>
        Allistic:
        <br>
        Allistic is the official term for any person who is not autistic.
        <br><br>
        Stimming:
        <br> 
        A ‘stim’ or the act of ‘stimming’ is short for Self-Stimulatory Behavior, which is a type of action an Autistic person may do to regulate themselves or even as a form of expressing their emotions. These actions are linked to an Autistic person’s sensory needs, and usually fall in a sensory category. These sensory categories include auditory, visual, olfactory, taste, tactile, vestibular, and more. Stims could be a repetitive noise or movement, such as tongue-clicking or knuckle-cracking, rubbing or touching a favorite texture, deep pressure or compression, spinning or rocking, et cetera. Every Autistic person stims differently. Stimming is also common among other neurodivergent communities such as the ADHD community, though Autistic people tend to stim the most. Many Autistic people also have tics and twitches, which may look like stims, but are partially or completely involuntary. Many people may see an Autistic person tic and rush to get them diagnosed with Tourette’s, when in reality, most Autistic people with tics do not have Tourette’s, as their ticcing is mild, infrequent, usually not vocal, and originates from their Autism, not an outside condition. Remember that stimming often happens subconciously, and that it is a healthy (and vital) regulation tactic, and unless a stim is dangerous or harmful, stimming should never be punished.
        <br><br>
        Masking:
        <br>
        Masking is the act of hiding or watering down Autistic traits in an attempt to fit in with neurotypical society. This may mean monitoring social rules, suppressing stims, powering through nonverbal episodes, and more. It is exhausting and mentally damaging. An Autistic person may start choosing to unmask around people they trust, especially once those people know that they are Autistic. This may make them seem “more autistic” than they were before, but in reality, it is just them unmasking traits that were always there, they just weren’t comfortable enough to express around you before. Also, unmasking is not immediate, and though it is extremely rewarding, it is not easy. Many high-masking autistics mask so much because it is an ingrained social survival tactic from their upbringing. Masking becomes second-nature, but that doesn’t mean it is any less exhausting. And though peeling off the mask is difficult and gradual, it is an extremely healing and freeing process.
        <br><br>
        Sensory Sensitivities:
        <br>
        The part of the brain that processes sensory input works differently in Autistic people, which results in certain types of sensory input being excessively bothersome, overwhelming, and often even physically painful. This can range anywhere from being unable to focus because of the lights humming, to feeling choked by intense scents, to the painful sensation of hot needles upon touching a certain type of fabric. They can affect any of the (more-than-five) senses, even internal sensations. Sensory issues vary person by person, day by day. They are widespread, complex, and affect every aspect of an autistic person’s day-to-day life.
        <br><br>
        Overstimulation:
        <br>
        When an Autistic person is overstimulated, it means they are receiving too much of a harmful type of input, and the sensory & processing areas of their brain don’t know how to handle it. Some Autistic people may become overstimulated by their sensory sensitivities, large crowds, sudden loud noises, overwhelming situations, or strong emotions, such as being yelled at for a reason they don’t understand. Overstimulation is distressing, disorienting, and often scary or even physically painful. Please be mindful when dealing with an overstimulated person that things that don’t bother you can be extremely sensorily distressing for them, and that this can change rapidly. For example, one day a fire alarm could be just an everyday bothersome noise, but the next day, could be the last straw that completely overstimulates the same person. Overstimulation is another phenomenon that, while more severe and prominent in the Autistic community, is present in other neurodivergent communities such as the ADHD community.
        <br><br>
        Meltdown/Shutdown:
        <br>
        There are many reasons an Autistic person may have a meltdown or shutdown. Reasons include overstimulation, autistic burnout, high-stress situations, et cetera. A meltdown may be often misinterpreted as a “tantrum” or “fit”, especially in children, and is often characterized by highly emotionally distressed behavior, sometimes including self-harm. Shutdowns, on the other hand, are more common among autistic adults, and are often characterized by numb, withdrawn, dissociative behavior. Both children and adults can experience both meltdowns and shutdowns, and both are a major, distressing event that may take anywhere from hours to days to recover from.
        <br><br>
        Nonverbal/Nonspeaking:
        <br>
        Some autistic people are nonverbal, meaning they do not communicate verbally. But many autistic people who can communicate verbally also experience nonverbal episodes. In fact, many autistics who experience nonverbal episodes are actually hyperverbal, meaning they usually talk much more than the average person, and generally love conversation. Nonverbal episodes vary, both by the person and by the episode. Some are brought on involuntarily by a stressful situation, overstimulation, or a meltdown or shutdown. Some happen seemingly randomly (especially in those who regularly push through episodes). Sometimes an autistic person may voluntarily go nonverbal as a regulation tactic. Some episodes result in the complete loss of speaking ability, while others make speaking extremely difficult and taxing, especially loudly or in long sentences. Often, higher-masking autistic people will push through the latter type of episode and speak anyway, which is exhausting and very bad for mental health. The more they do this, typically the more often episodes will occur. Though some autistic people prefer to be left alone during an episode, or sit silently with someone, many autistics actually have no less of a desire for conversation and communication than they usually do, and seek out non-verbal ways to hold a conversation. Common forms of nonverbal communication include writing & gestural languages (ASL, BSL, etc.). You may also see people use the term “nonspeaking”. It means the same thing as “nonverbal” and though some people have their preferences, they are used largely interchangeably.
        <br><br>
        Special Interest:
        <br>
        A Special Interest is like a hyperfixation in that it is a topic that a neurodivergent person is extremely invested in at the moment, but as opposed to hyperfixations, which come and go constantly and apply to the wider neurodivergent community, Special Interests are more drawn out, often more intense, and only apply to Autistic people. Special Interests are often held onto for years, or even a lifetime, and are often very important to the person. Many Autistic people love to talk with others about their Special Interests, whether it be giving someone a basic Crash Course or having a deep intelligent debate, they could typically go on for hours if given the time of day.
        <br><br>
        Echolalia/Palilalia:
        <br>
        Ecolalia is the repetition of sounds one hears, while palilalia is the repetition of sounds one has already made. Both are common behaviors in autistic people, and are often a form of stimming. It is usually voluntary (though often subconscious), but it is sometimes involuntary and automatic.
        <br><br>
        Alexithymia:
        <br>
        Alexithymia is an extremely common autistic trait that causes an Autistic person to struggle to identify or define what they are feeling. This is why autistic people often struggle to describe what they are feeling, because often they don’t even know what they’re feeling themselves. Many autistic people find it helpful to talk through these feelings in order to help try and identify them. Alexithymia, when combined with Depression and Trauma, often leads to extreme compartmentalization and perpetual feelings of numbness.
        <br><br>
        Traits vs Comorbid Traits vs Comorbidities:
        <br>
        Autistic Traits are pretty self-explanatory: traits of autism. Though these could also be described as symptoms, many in the autistic community feel that traits is a more accurate term. Comorbid traits, on the other hand, are traits that, if the person was not autistic, would be considered and treated as its own separate disorder, but since it is common for autistic people to have so many of them, when the person is autistic, these comorbid traits are often documented under the Autism umbrella for the sake of convenience. Examples of these include Sensory Processing Disorder, Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria, certain sleep disorders, etc. Comorbidities on the other hand, are completely separate mental health diagnoses that, while some often go hand-in-hand with ASD, cannot be explained by ASD or documented within the ASD umbrella, even if the person is confirmed autistic. These include ADHD, OCD, Dyslexia, Dyscalculia, Dysgraphia, Dyspraxia, Tourette’s, Anxiety Disorders, Mood Disorders, Personality Disorders, Stress Disorders, Depressive Disorders, and so on.
        <br><br>
        FAQ’s:
        <br><br>
        Should I say “autistic person” or “person with autism”?
        <br>
        Saying “autistic person” is considered ‘identity-first language’, whereas “person with autism” is considered ‘person-first language’. Though every Autistic person is entitled to their own opinion on what they’d like to be called, identity-first language (“autistic person”) is typically considered to be best. This is because it expresses how autism is not just something someone has, it is the entire way a person’s brain is structured, and an integral part of a person’s identity and the way they interpret and interact with society. Imagine if you went around saying “person with Asian-ness” instead of “Asian person” or “person with Christianity” instead of “Christian person”. It just wouldn’t make much sense.
        <br><br>
        Are autistic people disabled?
        <br>
        Yes, ASD is a federally-recognized disability, and therefore, all Autistic people are members of the disabled community. Members of the Autistic community (and often the disabled community at large), want people to realize that disabled is not a bad word, it is not rude to refer to someone as disabled, and the word “disabled” does not need to be replaced with words like “differently-abled”. In fact, most members of the community do not like being called “differently-abled”.
        <br><br>
        Busting Stereotypes:
        <br><br>
        Stereotype: Most autistic people are boys. <br>Reality: Gendercoding is a huge issue in the mental health field, especially autism. This means that it is much harder for autistic women & girls to get diagnosed, because people are only trained to recognize the signs in the male brain. This means that while the diagnosis rate is 4x higher for males, it is likely due to how hard it is to get diagnosed as a female.
        <br><br>
        Stereotype: Autistic people can’t make eye contact. <br>Reality: While many autistic people are uncomfortable with eye contact (it can be distracting or even painful to some), others simply don’t understand the social cues surrounding when and how to make eye contact. Therefore, many high-masking autistics make too much or very intense eye contact.
        <br><br>
        Stereotype: Autistic people are antisocial and want to be left alone. <br>Reality: While some autistics may feel this way, and many struggle with Social Anxiety, there are also many autistics who are extremely social and love going out and doing things with people. In fact, many autistics who felt left out and socially isolated as children crave social interaction to an unusual degree as adults. Being autistic doesn’t always include not wanting to socialize, it just means being not-so-great at it. And for those who do seem quiet and withdrawn, remember that being socially anxious doesn’t mean someone doesn’t want or need friends and social interaction.
        <br><br>
        Stereotype: Autistic people hate all parties and social functions. <br>Reality: While certain types of parties and functions can be overstimulating, don’t exclude an autistic person from an invite just because you think they won’t want to go. That's a decision for them to make. Many autistic people really enjoy certain types of parties, and you never know unless you invite them. Plus, being excluded can feel very hurtful, especially considering autistic people already often grow up being constantly excluded.
        <br><br>
        Stereotype: Autistic people hate to be touched. <br>Reality: While some Autistic people are uncomfortable with touch, others are totally fine with it, or may even like it more than the average neurotypical person. Some Autistic people are okay with certain types of touch and not okay with others, so be sure to ask their boundaries. Some Autistic people are fine with being touched and just struggle with the social cues surrounding touch. This means they may seem non-touchy-feely just because they aren’t sure when it’s situationally appropriate, so they avoid initiating it out of fear of being perceived as awkward.

        How to Support an Autistic Individual:
        <br><br>
        Educate Yourself: Autistic people want to be understood, so the first step to supporting your autistic friend or loved one is understanding them. You can do research on trusted sites such as [insert embraceautism url], or you can just ask the person. Many autistic people (especially those late-diagnosed) have done years of research to understand themselves, and have a wealth of information on the subject that they’d love to tell you about. In fact, some autistic people even have ASD itself as a special interest because of all the research they’ve done, and would talk about it all day if presented with an interested party. Remember: Asking an autistic person about their autism is NOT taboo, and most autistic people really appreciate it.
        <br><br>
        Don’t Rely On Stereotypes: There are a lot of stereotypes out there, and one of the most important things to remember is not to rely on them. Ask, don’t assume. Every Autistic person is different and has different needs and preferences. Click here to see some common stereotypes debunked.
        <br><br>
        Be A Safe Person for them to Unmask Around: Unmasking is extremely beneficial to an autistic person’s mental health. Let them know that you are a safe person to unmask around, and keep your word about it. Be accepting when they do start to unmask, even if their behaviors seem 'weird', and remember that unmasking is a slow and daunting task. Click here if you don’t know what masking/unmasking is.
        <br><br>
        Don’t Make It Awkward: One of the scariest things about disclosing an ASD diagnosis to friends and loved ones is the fear that they will no longer treat you like an equal, or that they will no longer want to truly be your friend. If a friend or loved one discloses their ASD diagnosis to you, remember that they are just as autistic as they were a moment ago before you knew about it. Do not walk on eggshells around their diagnosis. If they've shared it with you, that usually means they are open to questions and discussion. And definitely do not push them away or stop growing the friendship, wrongly assuming you can't be as close of friends because they're autistic. That really, really hurts.
        <br><br>
        Be There To Support When Hard Times Happen: Ask your Autistic friend or loved one how they’d like to be supported if they were to meltdown, shutdown, panic, go nonverbal, become overstimulated, etc. Having people there who know how that particular Autistic person would like to be supported during these times can really ease the stress of these experiences. For example, some Autistic people need to be left alone during a shutdown, while others might feel more comfortable having someone with them. Some may not want to be touched while overstimulated, while others may find touch helps calm and ground them while overstimulated. Every Autistic person’s support preferences are different.
        <br><br>
        Try to Support the Community: Trust your autistic friends and loved ones when it comes to issues the autistic community is facing, and if the opportunity arises and you feel comfortable enough, it is always appreciated when friends and loved ones openly support the community. We face many major issues and could always use the extra support.
        <br><br>
        Just Ask!: The best thing you can do to support your autistic friend or loved one is simply asking questions and being open to learning. Remember, ask, don't assume. If you are asking sincerely, pretty much nothing you could ask would be offensive. If you have a question, just ask it!
        <br><br>
        How to Support the Autistic Community:
        <br><br>
        Educate yourself about ASD, the autistic community, and the issues it’s facing. Be ready to advocate, but just make sure you are listening to, respecting, and not speaking over Autistic voices. Remember that you cannot be a true supporter of the community if you are not supporting the autistic individuals in your life. Learn more about supporting Autistic individuals above. An easy way to support the community is through support of organizations, signs, symbols, and events. However, be careful about which ones you support.

        DON’T: AutismSpeaks: They are a hate group that works directly against the agenda of the autistic community. They demonize autism in their advertisements and public statements, have laughably little representation in their leadership, almost none of their donations actually go to the people they claim to serve, and they even support research into eugenics programs designed to recognize autism in the womb so that autistic children can be aborted. <br><br>
        DO: Self-Advocacy Organizations: There are many amazing self-advocacy organizations out there, but a prominent example is ASAN, the Autistic Self-Advocacy Network
        <br><br>
        Symbols:<br>
        DON’T: Puzzle Piece: Not only was this symbol coined by AutismSpeaks (a hate group), it also symbolizes that we need to be solved, or that there is a piece missing from us, which is a very short-sighted view of Autism.<br><br>
        DO: Infinity Symbol: In relation to Autism, the infinity symbol is typically found in gold (because of the chemical symbol for Gold being Au) or a rainbow gradient (representing the Neurodiversity Pride Movement). Regardless of color, the autistic community has adopted the infinity symbol as the official symbol for Autism.
        <br><br>
        Movements:<br>
        DON’T: #LightItUpBlue: This is a campaign run by AutismSpeaks (a hate group), and purports the stereotype of ASD being a “boy’s disorder”, feeding into the major issue of gendercoding in the ASD diagnosis field.<br><br>
        DO: #RedInstead: This is a campaign run by actually autistic Autism Advocates as a direct counter to #LightItUpBlue, to fight against AutismSpeaks and gendercoding, and to support Autism Acceptance & Advocacy and a more informed view of ASD.
        <br><br>
        To show some extra spirit and support, recognize World Autism Day (April 2nd) and Autism Acceptance Month (April) with your autistic friends and loved ones. It’s a great time to show support and advocate!

        What's The Point?
        <br><br>
        Everyone already knows what Autism is, so why is visibility and advocacy so important?
        <br><br>
        - A majority of Allistic people are sorely misinformed about ASD, as there are tons of incorrect assumptions and misinformation floating around<br>
        - Autistic people are intensely discriminated against in schools, the workplace, and society in general<br>
        - Good Autistic representation in the media is almost non-existent, and rarely ever draws on the knowledge and experiences of actual Autistic people<br>
        - There is still massive stigma around Autism, and Autistic people are too often written off as incompetent<br>
        - Outdated views of Autism lead to high levels of late diagnosis (diagnosis after the age of ten), which is extremely harmful, and leads to higher instances of Depression, Anxiety Disorders, and Trauma/PTSD.<br>
        - Autistic people are more likely to experience mental illnesses, chronic illnesses, and autoimmune disorders than allistic people<br>
        - The life expectancy for Autistic adults is only 39 years, several decades shorter than the allistic life expectancy.<br>
        - Gendercoding makes it so hard for girls & women to get diagnosed, that diagnosis rates are 4x higher for boys, and while the average diagnosis age for boys is 2-3 years old, for girls it is 12-13 years old, which is considered late diagnosis and is an enormous disadvantage.<br>
        - Late-diagnosed Autistic teens are far more likely to be emotionally and physically abused by parents and other adults.<br>
        - Autistic teens & young adults (without Intellectual Disability) are 29x more likely to die by suicide than allistic teens & young adults<br>
        - 2/3 high-masking Autistic adults have considered suicide, and rates of self-harm are significantly higher among Autistics<br>
        - Mental Illness, Depression, Trauma, Self-Harm, and Suicide rates are all highest among high-masking, late-diagnosed women and girls ages 12-30<br>
